## 🔐 Data Persistence

### How It Works
- **localStorage** stores 3 keys:
  - `students` - Array of student objects
  - `coaches` - Array of coach objects
  - `branches` - Array of branch objects

### When Data Is Saved
- ✅ After creating a record
- ✅ After updating a record
- ✅ After deleting a record
- ✅ When importing data

### When Data Is Loaded
- ✅ On page load (reads from localStorage)
- ✅ Falls back to default data if localStorage is empty

---

## ⚠️ Validation & Safety

### Students
- ✅ Age must be 5-18
- ✅ Level must be 1-8
- ✅ Current lesson must be ≤ Total lessons
- ✅ Must select both branch and coach

### Coaches
- ⚠️ Cannot delete coaches with assigned students
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Phone number required

### Branches
- ⚠️ Cannot delete branches with students or coaches
- ✅ All fields required
- ✅ If branch name changes, updates cascade to students & coaches

---

## 🎨 UI Components

### Modals
- **Student Modal**: 8 fields, branch-filtered coach dropdown
- **Coach Modal**: 5 fields, branch selection
- **Branch Modal**: 4 fields for branch info
- **Delete Confirmation**: Safe delete with confirmation

### Notifications
- **Success Toast** (green): "Student created successfully!"
- **Error Toast** (red): "Cannot delete coach with students!"
- Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds

### Tables
- **Students Table**: View, Edit, Delete buttons
- **Coaches Table**: Shows student count, contact info
- **Branches Table**: Shows student/coach counts

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Saving
- ✔️ Check browser console for errors
- ✔️ Verify localStorage is enabled
- ✔️ Check localStorage size (5-10MB limit)

### Data Lost After Refresh
- ✔️ Verify CRUD operations are calling `saveDataToStorage()`
- ✔️ Check if private/incognito mode (localStorage disabled)
- ✔️ Export data regularly as backup!

### Coach Dropdown Empty
- ✔️ Select a branch first (coaches filter by branch)
- ✔️ Verify branch has coaches assigned

### Cannot Delete Coach/Branch
- ✔️ This is by design! (prevents orphaned records)
- ✔️ Reassign students/coaches first
- ✔️ Then delete will work
