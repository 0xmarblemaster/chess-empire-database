### 💾 Data Persistence

**Storage Method**: localStorage
- `students` - Student array
- `coaches` - Coach array
- `branches` - Branch array

**Capacity**: ~5-10MB (sufficient for 1000+ records)

**Initialization**:
1. On page load, check localStorage
2. If empty, use default data from data.js
3. Save defaults to localStorage
4. All subsequent operations use localStorage

**Data Flow**:
```
User Action → Modal Form → Validation → CRUD Function →
Update Array → Save to localStorage → Update UI → Show Notification
```

### 🔐 Safety Features

1. **Referential Integrity**
   - Cannot delete coaches with assigned students
   - Cannot delete branches with students or coaches
   - Cascading updates when branch name changes

2. **Validation**
   - Required field checks
   - Age range: 5-18
   - Level range: 1-8
   - Email format validation
   - Phone number required

3. **User Confirmation**
   - Delete operations require confirmation
   - Import data requires confirmation
   - Reset data requires confirmation

4. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks in all CRUD operations
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Console logging for debugging

### 📊 Statistics

**Lines of Code**: ~2,100 new lines
**Functions**: 45+ new functions
**Modals**: 4 modal types
**Management Views**: 3 (Coaches, Branches, Data)

### 🎨 UI Components

**Modal System**:
- Backdrop overlay with blur effect
- Smooth slide-up animation
- Close on ESC key
- Close on backdrop click

### 🔄 Integration Points

**With Existing Code**:
1. Uses existing `students`, `coaches`, `branches` arrays
2. Calls existing functions: `loadStudents()`, `loadStatistics()`
3. Updates existing dropdowns: `populateFilterDropdowns()`
4. Integrates with i18n system for translations
5. Uses existing CSS classes and styling

**New Dependencies**:
- None! Uses existing libraries:
  - Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
  - Lucide Icons (via CDN)
  - Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

### 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. **Student Operations**
   ```
   1. Create student → Check table updates
   2. Edit student → Verify changes persist
   3. Delete student → Confirm removal
   4. Refresh page → Verify data persists
   ```

2. **Coach Operations**
   ```
   1. Create coach → Check in student form dropdown
   2. Edit coach → Verify student assignments intact
   3. Try delete with students → Should fail
   4. Reassign students → Delete should work
   ```

3. **Branch Operations**
   ```
   1. Create branch → Check in dropdowns
   2. Edit branch name → Verify cascade to students/coaches
   3. Try delete with students → Should fail
   4. Delete empty branch → Should work
   ```

4. **Data Management**
   ```
   1. Export data → Check JSON file
   2. Modify data → Export again
   3. Import old file → Verify restore
   4. Reset data → Confirm defaults restored
   ```
